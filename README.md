# reimu
Simple python script that takes a youtube link as input and opens the video in Quicktime

To use, pass the url of the youtube video into reimu like so

`reimu https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=hW_iiNo2ECE`

This doesn't for some videos as parsing needs a little work at the moment.


# installation
If you wish to install the script globally on OSX, cd into the repository directory and run
`python setup.py develop`
Reimu should now be in your path.
